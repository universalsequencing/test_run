# Demo Run for TELL-Seq Data Analysis Pipelines 

## Overview

This repo is a demo for running TELL-Seq data analysis pipelines. It includes example scripts and a small Illumina seqeucing run data generated by TELL-Seq linked-read library.

## Test Data

After download or clone this repo, the first step is to recover the bcl run directory. 

```
cat test_run.tar.gza* > test_run.tar.gz
```

```
tar xzvf test_run.tar.gz
```
This will unpack into the bcl raw data directory ```210506_M06507_0113_000000000-DC6N8/```.


## Run Scripts

The scripts in the run_tellread, run_tellsort and run_tellink directories are example test scripts to run TELL-Seq data analysis pipelines.
